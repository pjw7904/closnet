"""Custom topology built based on the content of a GraphML file

Two arguments are required, in the following order:
1. the path the graphML file.
2. The naming prefix of the hosts, if there are hosts. If there are no hosts, just simply add None.

Adding a topology with hosts in it (ex: host prefix is h, for h1, h2, etc.):
sudo mn --custom GraphmlTopo.py --topo=graphmltopo,"/home/pjw7904/MTP-Mininet/graphs/host_test.graphml",h
